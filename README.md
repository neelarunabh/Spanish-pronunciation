# Spanish-pronunciation 

One of the main differences between Castilian Spanish and Andalusian/"Latin American" Spanish is the use of the /θ/ and /s/, /ʃ/ sounds. Castilian Spanish itself has two different pronunciations for this. In some areas in Northern Spain, "s" as well as its "sister consonants'' represent the /θ/ sound and "x" represents the /kθ/ sound. This feature is called "ceceo". In other parts of Northern Spain, "s" represents the /s/ and /ʃ/ sounds, its "sister consonants'' represent the /θ/ sound and "x" represents the /ks/ and /kʃ/ sounds. This feature is called "distinción". In Andalusian/"Latin American" Spanish, "s" as well as its "sister consonants'' represent the /s/ and /ʃ/ sounds and "x" represents the /ks/ and /kʃ/ sounds. This feature is called "seseo". In standard Spanish, the "h" is silent. However, some proper names and borrowed words maintain an aspiration. In these words, the /χ/ sound is used in Castilian Spanish and the /x/ or /h/ sound is used in Andalusian/"Latin American" Spanish. Then look at the pronunciation of "j", "ge'', "gi". In Castilian Spanish, "j" represents the /χ/ sound and in Andalusian/"Latin American" Spanish, "j" represents the /x/ or /h/ sound. Then look at the pronunciation of "x" in some proper names. There also, the /χ/ sound is used in Castilian Spanish and the /x/ or /h/ sound is used in Andalusian/"Latin American" Spanish.
